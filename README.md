# FLIGHTS-DELAY-PREDICTION-USING-RF


Introduction
This project is based on the flights data analysis where our main goal is to perform some exploratory data
anlaysis on the dataset and then apply data mining algorithms to predict the delay of a flight. The dataset
selected is taken from Kaggle which is a public repository for datasets. The data consists of nine features in
total which contains below information:
1. ID: This act as an identifier to identify each observation in the dataset uniquely.
2. Airline: This tells us the Airline for a specific observation in the dataset.
3. AirportFrom: This tells us about the origin of flight.
4. AirportTo: This tells us about the destination of flight.
5. Flight: This tells us the flight number assigned to each flight.
6. DayOfWeek: This tells us tha day of week on whcih flight took place for each flight in the dataset.
7. Time: The time of flight is present in this column of dataset.
8. Length: The length of flight in minutes.
9. The delay which is our target variable. This is a binary classification problem. We have two possible
outputs, either the flight is delayed or its not
